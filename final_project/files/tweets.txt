The Lightning Thief movie has the best plot twist because people went into a cinema thinking you’re gonna see a Percy Jackson movie and instead see the percy jackson books tossed into a meat grinder and ruined!

109. Wook’s Top Movies List- 2001 A Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick created possibly 1 of the greatest Science accurate Space movies that’s quite possibly too hard to fit into Science Fiction or Space Fantasy; It’s a unique mix w/a score that resonates through your entire soul

108. Wook’s Top movies list- Fight Club: I’m not sure what to write because….WE DON’T TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!

105. Wook’s Top Movies of all time: Blade Runner 2049: I watched this for the 4th time & I’ve decided I need to watch this more. This is an exemplary SciFi w/every actor performing perfectly but Dave Bautista out acting everyone in such a small cameo that resonates throughout

106. Wook’s Top Movies of All Time- Evil Dead 2: Ash is eternal & he is the ultimate reluctant hero & this movie is the absolute perfect platform for his special type of comedic style. It’s over the top riotous gory fun!
